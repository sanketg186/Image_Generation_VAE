## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, we will dive into the Anime dataset which is available on Kaggle([Anime dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/anime)). In order to understand the how image generation models (VAE, HVAE and GANs) work.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
This folder contains jupyter notebooks.
